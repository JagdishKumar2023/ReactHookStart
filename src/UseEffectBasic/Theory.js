// When explaining useCallback in an interview, you'll want to convey its purpose, usage, and benefits clearly. Here's a structured way to do that:

// Introduction to Purpose:
// "The useCallback hook in React is designed to optimize the performance of your application by memoizing callback functions. It ensures that these functions are only recreated when their dependencies change, preventing unnecessary re-renders in your components."

// Why Use useCallback:
// "In React, passing functions as props to child components can sometimes cause those components to re-render unnecessarily, especially if the function is recreated on each render. useCallback helps mitigate this issue by memoizing the function, so it's only recreated when needed."

// How to Use useCallback:
// "To use useCallback, you simply call it and pass in the callback function you want to memoize, along with an array of dependencies. React will then memoize the function and only recreate it if any of the dependencies change."

// Example:
// Provide a practical example to illustrate how useCallback works in a real-world scenario. You can use a simple increment counter example like the one mentioned earlier.

// When to Use useCallback:
// "You should use useCallback when passing callbacks to child components that rely on reference equality to prevent unnecessary re-renders. It's particularly helpful in larger applications where optimizing performance is crucial."

// Summary:
// "In summary, useCallback is a powerful tool in React for optimizing performance by memoizing callback functions. It helps prevent unnecessary re-renders in components, especially when passing callbacks to child components, ultimately improving the efficiency of your React application."
